## Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 

**Key Milestones in the Evolution of Software Engineering**

**Introduction of Software Engineering (1968 - NATO Conference)**
The term "software engineering" was first used during the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the emerging problems in software development, often referred to as the "software crisis." As software projects grew more complex, many faced significant challenges, including failures, budget overruns, and unreliability. This conference highlighted the need for more organized methods in software creation, leading to the integration of engineering principles into this field.

**The Emergence of Structured Programming (1970s)**
In the early 1970s, a new approach called structured programming was developed to make coding easier to understand and maintain. Influential figures like Edsger Dijkstra emphasized the importance of clear control flow and encouraged developers to avoid using "goto" statements, which could make programs confusing. This method fostered the growth of new programming styles, including procedural programming and modular design, which form the basis of modern software development practices.

**The Rise of Agile and DevOps (2000s - Present)**
In 2001, the Agile Manifesto introduced a more flexible and collaborative way to create software, focusing on working closely with customers and delivering products quickly. Agile practices, such as Scrum and Kanban, gained popularity and replaced older, more rigid approaches. In the 2010s, the DevOps movement emerged, blending development and operations teams to enhance cooperation and speed up processes like automated testing and software delivery. These advancements have significantly improved the efficiency of software development, resulting in high-quality products delivered faster than ever before.






## List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. 
**Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a step-by-step approach used to create and maintain software, which is essentially the programs and applications we use on our computers and devices. Here’s a breakdown of the main phases in this process:

1. **Planning**  
   In this phase, the team outlines what the project is about, what it aims to achieve, and whether it’s possible to complete it. They also assess potential risks, figure out what resources (like time and people) will be needed, and set a timeline for the entire project.

2. **Requirements Analysis**  
   Here, the team collects information about what the software needs to do. They talk to the people who will use the software to understand their needs and ensure that all requirements—both functional (what the software should do) and non-functional (how the software should perform)—are documented.

3. **Design**  
   During this phase, the team creates a blueprint for the software. They plan out how the software will be structured, its user interfaces, and how different parts of the software will work together. This includes both high-level design (big picture) and detailed design (specifics).

4. **Implementation (Coding)**  
   This is the phase where the actual coding happens. Developers write the instructions that computers will follow, based on the earlier designs. They choose programming languages, frameworks, and tools to help them build the software.

5. **Testing**  
   Once the software is built, this phase involves checking it for errors or bugs. Various types of tests are done to ensure that everything works as intended and that the software meets the requirements established earlier.

6. **Deployment**  
   After testing is complete and everything is working well, the software is released for users to start using. Different strategies for rolling it out are considered, depending on what works best for the users and the organization.

7. **Maintenance and Support**  
   Once the software is in use, the team continues to help by fixing any issues that arise, making updates, and adding improvements. This ensures the software continues to function well and remains secure over time.

Each of these phases is critical in making sure that software is developed efficiently, meets user needs, and stays effective and secure once it’s in use.
